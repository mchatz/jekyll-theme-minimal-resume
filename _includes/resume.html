    <h1>My Objective</h1>
    <p>
        I'm looking for an opportunity that provides meaningful impact to products, users, and the people on my team. I love looking for pain points and fixing them. While we should not dwell on failures or shortcomings, without identifying them we cannot move forward into the future. I enjoy building and leading teams by focusing on each person's strengths instead of always trying to fix their weaknesses. My goal is to make the company I work for the best in a smart, balanced way.
